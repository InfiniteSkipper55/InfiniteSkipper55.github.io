<h1 style="color:red;">12) Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</h1>

<b>Developer:</b> Nintendo EAD Tokyo<br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Nintendo<br>
<b>Genre:</b> Action, Puzzle<br>
<b>Year Released:</b> 2014<p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
The game builds upon the <i>"Adventures of Captain Toad"</i> levels in <i>Super Mario 3D World</i>, where the basic gameplay model had been introduced. In the game, players control Captain Toad, a Toad, and his companion Toadette into safely navigating through various obstacles and reach a gold star at the end of each level. Completing the game allows players to see the link between Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Super Mario 3D World, and having save data from the latter or beating Treasure Tracker allows players to play four 3D World levels as Captain Toad.<p>

The player can manipulate the camera to view around the level, which can reveal hidden areas containing bonus items. Both characters can be hit once before dying, but they collect mushrooms to restore their health. As in Super Mario 3D World, Captain Toad can also walk and run, but cannot jump while carrying a heavy backpack. As in Super Mario Bros. 2, he can pull up plants from the ground, which yield either collecting coins or throwing turnips at enemies. He can also use Super Pickax to clear out enemies and obstacle blocks, that is similar to the hammer in Donkey Kong. The game makes use of the Wii U GamePad's features, as the player can touch the screen to manipulate platforms, blow on the microphone to activate certain platforms, and use gyroscopic controls to aim turnips while riding mine carts. The game makes use of amiibo: using the Toad amiibo places a "pixel Toad" in levels for Captain Toad to find, in the style of hide and seek; other figurines give the player extra lives.<p>
