<h1 style="color:red;">15) The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD</h1>

<b>Developer:</b> Tantalus Nintendo EPD<br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Nintendo<br>
<b>Genre:</b> Action, Adventure<br>
<b>Year Released:</b> 2016<p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD</i> is largely unchanged from that in the original title, Twilight Princess. As in all previous The Legend of Zelda games, players control the series' main protagonist, a young swordsman named Link. In combat, Link primarily uses a sword and shield, bow and arrows, boomerang, and bombs.<p>

Similar to The Wind Waker HD, many of the gameplay tweaks present in Twilight Princess HD involve its support for the Wii U GamePad. The controller's touchscreen displays a map of the current area and Link's inventory, allowing the player to quickly switch items. Projectiles can be aimed using the GamePad's motion controls; the game can be played solely on the controller via Off-TV Play. The player can swap between Link's human and wolf forms faster by pressing a button on the touchscreen. The Wii U Pro Controller is also supported.<p>

Scanning the Wolf Link Amiibo figurine transports the player character to a Wii U-exclusive challenge dungeon called the "Cave of Shadows" and can carry data over to Breath of the Wild. Other Zelda-related Amiibo figurines have distinct functions: Link and Toon Link replenish arrows, Zelda and Sheik restore Link's health, and Ganondorf causes Link to take twice as much damage.<p>

In the Cave of Shadows, Link fights waves of enemies while restricted to his wolf form. Comparable to the optional "Cave of Ordeals" present in the original release, opportunities to recover health during the trial are sparse. The player unlocks portions of the Cave of Shadows while advancing in the game.<p>

"Hero Mode", a higher difficulty setting first introduced in Skyward Sword, returns in Twilight Princess HD. Activating the Ganondorf Amiibo while in Hero Mode quadruples the amount of damage Link normally takes when hit.<p>
