    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        EA may have been a bit slow to come around to the wonders Xbox Live, but their first college pigskin game was good enough to make even the staunchest of EA haters quiet down a bit. Still running on a modified version of the Madden engine, NCAA Football 2003 had so many features surrounding the actual on-field game that it was nearly a college fan's dream come true. Over 100 teams, rivalry games, fight songs, a create-a-school mode, dynasty mode, and more all come together in one of the first games to truly bring the collegiate feel to a football game. There's so much here that more recent NCAA games feel limited in comparison.

        NCAA Football 2004 may have improved a bit upon this iteration, but 2003 brought the most to the table, especially for the Xbox as a whole. 2003 delivered a fantastic football experience and marked the beginning of the progression towards the college game's eventual dominance in the football video game market.
