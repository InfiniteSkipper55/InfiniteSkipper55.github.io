    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't like Ninja Gaiden Black, it is because you're not a true ninja and can't handle the insane levels of difficulty. For heart-pumping, adrenaline-filled, blade-wielding, off-the-wall, insane action, there is no better choice on the Xbox than Ninja Gaiden Black. The first new-generation Ninja Gaiden game was excellent, but this special edition re-release showed the world the right way to repackage a game with new modes and levels of difficulty, new items, improved control, and boatloads of new gameplay opportunities. Even if you had already played the first Ninja Gaiden Xbox title, you had to give this one a look. It simply is the ultimate Xbox action experience.

    <p>
        Ninja Gaiden Black isn't just the best action game on the Xbox. It's also one of the finest examples of the power held in the big, black box. Even with the great AI and numerous enemies on screen, Ninja Gaiden Black put its competition to shame. Smooth, crisp, and beautiful, this game is every bit as good-looking as it is fun.
