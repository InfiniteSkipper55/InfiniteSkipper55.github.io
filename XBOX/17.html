    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Though Microsoft and Fasa Studio stumbled a few times while transitioning the fabulous Crimson Skies PC game to Xbox, the final result was tailor-made for the console. A beautiful-looking game built with strong Hollywood movie cinematics and production values, Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge was like playing an Indiana Jones movie in the air.

        The gameplay was simplified from the PC version, i.e., made even more forgiving and easy to handle, but the wild range of airplanes was incredibly fun to handle, whether you were being chased, chasing an enemy, or pulling off snap turns and Immelmans. The flying wasn't realistic at all. In fact, the game felt more like an action game with wings than a flying game in the manner of PS2's ace flight game, Ace Combat. But the 12-hour single-player campaign earned you all sorts of enhancements, new planes, and enough skill to connect to Xbox Live and play for the rest of the holiday. While Secret Weapons Over Normandy and Battlestar Galactica might have had their own appeal, Crimson Skies was the Mac Daddy of flying games on Xbox and still holds its own today.
