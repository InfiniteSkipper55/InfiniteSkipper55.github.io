    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        When Acclaim first showed us Burnout 1 in 2001, we were floored by its speed, visceral impact and potential. Two games later under the publishing helm of Electronic Arts, Criterion's uber-arcade game reached its true potential and grabbed the racing crown from Polyphony Digital's spectacular Gran Turismo series with one of the best racing games on any system, Burnout 3: Takedown.

    <p>
        The code-crunching team at Criterion delivered an unflappable framerate, stunning sense of speed, and unholy crash sequences that, combined with new takedown elements, super aggressive AI racers, and online support, made this the most desired racer both instantly enjoyable and maddeningly addictive. Criterion added excellent new modes such as the brilliant Road Rage, Eliminator, Face-off Burning Lap, as well as grand prix, and feature mechanics such as aftertouch, an uncannily perfect gameplay feature that gives life to your flaming skeleton of metal well after the crash. Visually and sonically, Burnout: Aftertouch also excelled in every way with fantastic crash scenarios, eye-popping particles and sharp samples and sounds that matched its visual intensity. At its core, Burnout 3 easily vies for fastest racer ever created and it's frighteningly satisfying to play.
