    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Knights of the Old Republic is a landmark title in the Xbox library for more reasons than we can succinctly describe. It didn't just show us how good a Star Wars licensed game could be; it brought the Xbox to the forefront of RPG fans' minds the world over. With lightsabers, force powers, an amazing story, and some of the most memorable characters on Xbox, Knights of the Old Republic had universal appeal for good reason.

        Simply being a Star Wars RPG may have been enough to endear Knights of the Old Republic to most people, but BioWare didn't let the branding do all of the work while they sat back and reaped the rewards. The story here rivals even Lucas's original trilogy with one of the best twists in videogame history and more unique, yet familiar, characters than you could ever hope for. Jade Empire may have seen over the mountain, but only because it was standing on the shoulders of KOTOR.
