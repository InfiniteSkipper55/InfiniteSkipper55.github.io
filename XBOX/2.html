    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Halo 2 wasn't just a game. It was a full-blown entertainment phenomenon. With $125 million in sales on the first day alone, it became the biggest single event in entertainment history. People lined up hours in advance and sat through all manners of weather to be amongst the first to get the most hyped game of all time. Then, somehow, Halo 2 managed to come as close as possible to living up to that hype.

        Say what you will about the somewhat confused story mode, the online game alone is nearly enough to get Halo 2 to the top of our list. Full clan and party support, excellent matchmaking, tons of customization options, and innovative web options all combined to give Halo 2 the best Live experience to date. Halo 2 provided everything we could have wanted in Xbox Live and helped set the stage for the Xbox 360's current success. Oh, and did we mention that Halo 2 online still provides a huge adrenaline rush to this day? Well, it does. There's a reason Halo 2 was the most played Xbox Live game until Gears of War shipped. It simply is the complete online package.
