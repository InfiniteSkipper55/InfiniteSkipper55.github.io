    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        After re-tooling the offenses in Madden NFL 2004, EA came up really big, perhaps with its biggest and brightest football game of them all, in Madden NFL 2005. Florida-based Tiburon successfully implemented new working elements in this iteration that made everyone re-think their past football experiences.

    <p>
        Once you experimented with and mastered the defensive Hit Stick, tinkered with defensive hot routes, and finally, once you used offensive formation shifts, it was impossible to return to the old way of Madden, and in some folks' minds, to return to Visual Concepts' gridiron titles. Madden NFL 2005 brought depth and ingenuity to the game on offense and defense. Defensive AI players swatted more balls, intercepted more throws, and covered the ball on the ground better than ever before. On offense, calling audibles, using Playmaker, and calling orange routes, or option routes, made huge differences. The franchise mode and the online game really branched out too.

        While Madden has taken a slight turn south in recent years, on Xbox, the best Madden game on the console was 2005.
