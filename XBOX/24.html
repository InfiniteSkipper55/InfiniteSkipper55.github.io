    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        The first few waves of Xbox games were electric, irregular, and even a little sketchy. But as Microsoft grew as a manufacturer and publisher, it found its feet. In 2005, the publisher's focus gave birth to a competitive simulation racer that could content with Sony's Gran Turismo series. The internal Microsoft team behind Forza were admitted GT huge fans, but like everyone else they grew tired of Polyphony Digital's redundancy and lack of change.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the innovation scale, Forza ranks answered long-burning GT issues, giving players the ability to play the single-player campaign offline or online, giving cars three levels of damage, creating the Drivatar, which learned drivers' patterns and could be commanded to race challenges for you, and creating hundreds of leaderboards (not to mention putting a racer in the car).
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps more fun than anything else was its sophisticated and deep customization system that inspired people do crazy things with their cars. Forza is perhaps the only other racer on the consoles that was able to re-create the magic in GT in a different and compelling way.
