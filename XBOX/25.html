    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        You've got to have soul. Nearly every Xbox owner knows that thanks to Jet Set Radio Future, along with SEGA GT, getting the Xbox pack-in treatment. Microsoft thought it was good enough to help sell consoles and, although JSRF may have been a bit out there and unique for the action loving Xbox fans, it certainly delivered on its promise. The Xbox sequel to the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio didn't just provide gamers with a bigger and better looking city to grind, tag and trick their way through, it took every criticism leveled at the first game and reworked the way the game played. The result was a much friendlier and fast paced game that had more style and funk than George Clinton.

        Jet Set Radio Future is so unique that the only other game just like it is Jet Grind Radio. For that alone it deserves to be on this list, but JSRF has the whole package. It's fun, stylistic, visually impressive, and has a fantastic soundtrack. Beyond that, JSRF is a huge reason the hardcore SEGA audience embraced the Xbox despite its new kid on the block status. Long live Professor K.
