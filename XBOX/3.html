    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox represents the pinnacle of the series. From a gameplay standpoint, everything about it was honed, enhanced, and improved upon over its predecessor with tight controls, great level design, and beautiful graphics.<br>

        From an audio-visual perspective, Sam's world is one of the best-looking games on the system, replete with gorgeous animations, meticulous texture work, and realistic lighting and shadows -- all of which were strengths in the previous versions and bettered in Chaos Theory. Ubisoft also upped the ante with a highly polished adversarial mode and new on- and offline co-op missions, giving it new life after the tough but engaging Pandora Tomorrow.

        Equipped with new moves, a knife, sniper and shotgun attachments for the SC-20K, and alternate fire options that interfere with electrical circuits and disable lights for a short period of time, Fisher, the bad-ass, got even badder. All of this took place with a robust, multi-tiered alert system that created gameplay options, rather than limiting them. Finally, the four new specially designed cooperative levels, and the 11 new multiplayer maps were all built around a more full-bodied set of modes, both offline and online, giving this game legs well beyond its excellent single-player mode.
