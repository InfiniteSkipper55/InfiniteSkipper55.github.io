    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        BioWare knows how to make a fantastic RPG. The follow-up to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire showed that knowledge and then some. Though many fans were frustrated at BioWare's decision to eschew work on KOTOR II in favor of an original IP, the move paid off in spades. The Wuxia-kung fu film and Chinese mythology inspired world gave us an original and wondrous story to get lost in that few games could compare with.

        It wasn't just the well-crafted world that set Jade Empire apart from the pack. The real-time action-oriented combat system was deep yet accessible and provided a fresh look at the way RPG battles could play out. Jade Empire also further refined the morality system they laid out in Knights of the Old Republic with branching philosophical paths the player could take. In fact, everything that BioWare did right in their previous game wasn't just included in Jade Empire, it was improved to new levels of excellence. Jade Empire had everything you could want in an RPG; a beautiful world, great story, and excellent combat. The game was so well constructed that it was a must-play title even for people that don't like RPGs. It's just that good.
