    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Although Psychonauts didn't meet with commercial success, the universal opinions of critics were that Tim Schafer had done it again. The man whose original mind helped to bring us Grim Fandango and The Secret of Monkey Island delivered Psychonauts to the Xbox with high expectations of humor and imaginative gameplay.

        Imaginative may be the best way to describe Psychonauts, too, as the platformer pits Raz, a psychic camper, in levels that take place inside other characters' minds. Each level is designed around that character's persona, which provides insane, hilarious, and bizarre environments and challenges. Of course, it wouldn't be a Tim Schafer game without some chuckles (exemplified mostly through dialog) and in that area Psychonauts does not disappoint. The cutscenes in between stories are sure to make you smile and it's hard not to enjoy yourself while playing a game that knows you're there to have fun. If Psychonauts had an influence on other games, we haven't seen it yet. But surely, the game must have had an effect on game story writers and the boundaries they're able to cross. We're still waiting for the game that somehow puts us inside our minds.
