    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: Sand of Time wasn't a perfect game (but then again no game is). It was rather short, there weren't too many boss fights, and there weren't all that many puzzles. Having laid down these criticisms and knowing them full well enables us to look at the game with clear, rather than with rose-colored, glasses. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was a major evolution in the series and, to a certain extent, cross-genre games in general. More to the point, Sands of Time was an astounding example of cutting-edge game mechanics, character animations, and art design. It still is.

        POP brought an ancient 2D game into the current generation and made it better in most ways, so much so that few people still wished they could play the old one, and it imagined and delivered gameplay that people had only dreamed about before blending three genres (action, adventure, and platforming) perfectly. It didn't matter which system you played it on, either, Xbox, PS2, GameCube, or PC. It was beautiful looking, smartly told, mechanically exemplary and compelling, and underneath it all, a great game. And surprisingly, neither of the sequels had the long-term impact nor was as impressive as that first one.
