    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Originally created for the PC, Red Storm's, and then when Ubisoft bought Red Storm, Ubisoft's Rainbow Six series evolved into a mass market product that has served the hardest of the hardcore shooter, casual gamers, and military fanatics alike on multiple systems. On the Xbox in 2003, Ubisoft saw opportunity knocking and tapped into the growing Xbox Live community with a real team-based tactical shooter that grabbed IGN's editorial team attention and never let go.

        While the single-player missions didn't blow the lids off any doors, the team mechanics and controls were solid, and multiple door approaches into terrorist's barracks gave you a feeling of control and tactical command. And after you finished those off, the substantial co-op and the multiplayer missions kept you riveted for days and weeks afterwards with your friends offline or online. Overall, the powerful range of weaponry, the smart mechanics, the quick impact of a kill, and the sense of camaraderie created while playing on Xbox Live all came together to satisfy our gaming souls.
