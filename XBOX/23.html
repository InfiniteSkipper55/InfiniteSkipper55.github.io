    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Electronic Arts toyed for many years with Knockout Kings before the strange but lovable Rocky game caught our attention. And while EA might not be pushing the envelope with sports now, over the last five years the publisher underwent a small revolution in its approach to all sports games in features, physics, and mechanics. With Fight Night Round 2, EA took the previous year's excellent first effort and went to town like a mad, inspired elf on Christmas Eve.

        Visually, EA delivered stunning, real-life boxer lookalikes with Winky Wright, Roy Jones, and cover boy Bernard Hopkins. The blood, sweat, skin textures and motion capture were exemplary. The refreshing cutman mini-game opened the game up a little between rounds, and while the announcers were only decent, the sound effects -- whether they were perfectly connecting haymakers, gut punches or perfect knockout punches -- rang true. Aside from the graphics, EA hand-delivered the ability to punch while moving, the clench, and specialized analog controls that worked like a champ. The haymaker system was a huge boon.
