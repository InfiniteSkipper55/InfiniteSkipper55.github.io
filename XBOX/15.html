    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Morrowind brought something to the Xbox that console players had previously been deprived; a truly open and free RPG experience. This game didn't just allow you to create your own character, it let you attack the world in any way you pleased. Want to ignore the main quest and go spelunking? Go for it. Want to try to wipe out every Argonian lizard? Get a good sword and start hacking. Nearly anything you wanted to do was yours to attempt. This game wasn't just good, it was a landmark in the history of console RPGs.

        With so few great RPGs even on the Xbox, Morrowind would have made it even higher on the list if it weren't for its unfortunate number of bugs. With so much freedom came so many times we watched our game crash. Even with all of the frustrations, Morrowind was still amongst the most addicting games out there with hundreds of quests, thousands of unique objects, and more bang for your buck than you could ever hope for.
