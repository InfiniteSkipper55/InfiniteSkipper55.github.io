    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        When looking back on The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, the biggest water-cooler topic was, and still is, the comparison to the movie. With the exception of GoldenEye 007, no game has so outshined its big-screen counterparts as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. It's all true. The game was way better than the movie sequel.

        There is so much more to Riddick. While it's also true replay was at a minimum (unless you wanted to collect all the cigarette packs) and multiplayer didn't exist, Riddick was an exclusive Xbox game that blended first-person shooting, fighting, stealth, and RPG-elements into one smartly presented and told science fiction universe. Vin Diesel's perfectly delivered voice acting lent great credibility to the game's audio feel, and Starbreeze's handling of the story and presentation was masterful, a difficult task given how much was known and saved for the movie sequel. Riddick's unique Eyeshine abilities, the game's multiple paths and NPC side-quests, and its debut of normal mapping distinguished it even further from the masses of first-person shooters that littered the Xbox.
