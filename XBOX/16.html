    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Two years after Grand Theft Auto III burst onto PS2, publishers and developers alike were still standing back in awe. The thug-simulator sandbox hit was a success beyond everyone's wildest dreams and creative minds across the planet began their own versions of GTA. Taking hard lessons from DMA's success and finding EA difficult to work with, Pandemic split with EA on what would have been the newest iteration in the Strike series and signed with LucasArts to make Mercenaries, an open-world military game that fused the wily openness of GTA with the destructive power of MechAssault.

        Mercenaries offered players three characters to choose from and a whole world of open destruction in North Korea. A myriad of elements made the game fun. The vehicles were numerous, from pedestrian cars to jeeps to tanks to helicopters, and you could use them or go it on foot to get any job done. The weapon packages grew more and more powerful as you progressed, until you could level whole buildings and shoot down helicopters. And playing the five factions off one another added a level of tension and surprise.<br>
        While Mercenaries was more or less influenced by Grand Theft Auto III and a wide range of military games, it wasn't so influential on other games, although Pandemic is now making Mercenaries 2: World in Flames with online co-op capabilities.
