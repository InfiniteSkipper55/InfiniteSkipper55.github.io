    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        The Panzer Dragoon series is almost legendary around the IGN offices. It began on the Saturn and reached an audience far too small for games as good as these. When SEGA gave up on the console market and became a third party publisher, Panzer Dragoon Orta was amongst the first titles announced for the Xbox. Fans would not be disappointed.

    <p>
        The pinnacle of rail shooters, Panzer Dragoon Orta took the series to new heights. Even now at the end of the Xbox's life, Panzer Dragoon Orta remains one of the most beautiful games on the console with fantastic design chock full of vibrant imagery mingled with post-apocalyptic despair. Fantastic visuals aside, Orta succeeded in delivering deep shooting mechanics the way no rail shooter had in the past, or has since. You can zip through the game a few short sittings, but then you'll revisit it over and over again as your skills improve and those seemingly impossible targets begin to open up. Rail shooters may be all but dead, but at least they went out on the highest note possible.
