    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        You couldn't plant an acorn and come back later to find a tree. Children in Albion would not change their hairstyle to mimic yours. There weren't branching story paths. In fact, much of what Peter Molyneux and Lionhead promised in their "ultimate RPG" never panned out. But guess what? The game is still an absolute blast to play. Microsoft's best answer to Zelda, Fable isn't a game that's made for the hardcore RPG gamer. It's not made for the hardcore action or adventure gamer either. It's made for everyone and has enough layers to provide both a superficial and exceptionally deep experience in one tight little package.

    <p>
        Fable wins with its exceptional world design and great good vs. evil dichotomy. Every town, region, and dungeon was handcrafted with loving detail so that every nook just screamed to be explored. The story may not have been the most engaging in the history of the RPG, but the fluid action mechanics and well-designed skill progression tree made for an RPG that was fun to play regardless of which genre of game you prefer.
