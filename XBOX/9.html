    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Nobody tries harder year in and year out than the indefatigable Visual Concepts, which manages to thwart its competition with ingenuity, hard work and fewer resources despite being out-marketed every season. And this is why the competition of two major, NFL licensed football games created the best atmosphere for competition and for great games during the former generation of consoles (on PS2, Xbox and GameCube). Finally, however, Sega and 2K Games called Madden out. They upped the ante with its combo-package of ESPN NFL 2K5, a fantastic new football game in its own right, which sold for only $20.

        The game had an angle for everything. The ESPN presentation was smartly integrated into the game from smart on-field camera angles to the right announcers (you could even watch SportsCenter in between games), it presented realistic and impressive graphics and even better animations, and it packed in a superb VIP systems, training sessions before games, and debuted online leagues. Visual Concepts even gave gamers the very likeable ESPN25th Anniversary mode. The running was tightened down and the passing was loosened up a little, the Franchise mode was improved, and in every way thinkable, this mighty $20 just couldn't be beat for the value. Ironically, it was also Visual Concepts' last official football game for years. Still, when compared to the football games of the last few seasons, ESPN NFL 2K7 holds up like the Bus on Superbowl Sunday.
