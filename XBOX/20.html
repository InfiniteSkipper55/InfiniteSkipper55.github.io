    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>
        Sports licenses are a finicky thing. After EA bought the exclusive rights to make exclusive NFL games, Take-Two fired back by purchasing Visual Concepts and the exclusive rights to major league baseball. In the videogame world, these dealings are bigger than the Red Sox paying $51 million for the rights to talk to Daisuke Matsuzaka. Rather than running off into the corner and pouting, EA Canada delivered its finest MLB-licensed baseball game yet (it already had the license for this one) and the best Xbox fans ever knew.

        While the previous year's MVP 2004 brought a ton of new modes and features to the baseball videogame world, EA's last stand with MVP 2005 refined it to greatness. It also added the owner mode, the "hitter's eye," mini-games and more. With its hold on the MLB license for that last year, EA showed us all that it wouldn't sit on its laurels after losing the baseball license in a display that made us enjoy competition all the more.
