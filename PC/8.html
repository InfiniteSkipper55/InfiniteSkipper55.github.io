<h1 style="color:red;">8) Fortnite</h1><p>

<b>Developer:</b> Epic Games<br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Epic Games<br>
<b>Genre:</b> Various<br>
<b>Year Released:</b> 2017<p>

<h2>Summary:</h2> Currently, <i>Fortnite</i> is distributed as two different games, though each game uses the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fortnite: Save the World</b> is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like <i>"husks"</i>. The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.</li>

    <li><b>Fortnite Battle Royale</b> is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, playing alone or in squads of two to four. Players airdrop from a <i>"Battle Bus"</i> that crosses the game's map without any weapons. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, and resources, avoiding being killed while attacking other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming storm; players outside that safe area take damage and can be killed. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player or squad alive is the winner.</li>
</ul><p>

In both modes, players can use a pickax to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources, like wood, brick, and metal, to build fortifications with, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within <i>"Save the World"</i> this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In <i>"Battle Royale"</i>, this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.<p>
