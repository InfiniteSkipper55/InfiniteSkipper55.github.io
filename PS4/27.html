<h1 style="color:red;">27) DOOM</h1>

<b>Developer:</b> id Software<br>

<b>Genre:</b> First-Person Shooter<br>
<b>Year Released:</b> 2016<p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
According to id Software Executive Producer Marty Stratton, the key principles of <i>Doom's</i> single-player mode are "badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast". The game allows players to perform movements such as double-jumps and ledge-climbs throughout levels of industrial and corporate fields of a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on Mars and then levels of Hell, as the combat system puts emphasis upon momentum and speed. The approach is known as "push-forward combat" which discourages the players from taking cover behind obstacles or resting to regain health while playing from the "Doom Slayer"'s perspective. Players instead collect health and armor pick-ups by killing enemies. "Glory Kills" is a newly introduced melee execution system; when enough damage has been dealt to an enemy, the game will highlight it and allow the player to perform a quick and violent melee takedown as well as reward the player with extra health.<p>

The game features a large arsenal of weapons which can be collected and freely switched by players throughout the game and require no reloading. Recurring weapons of the series also make a return, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity, but is extremely powerful. Similarly, the chainsaw returns, but has been reintroduced as a special-use weapon that relies upon fuel, but can be used to instantly cut through enemies and provide a greater-than-normal drop of ammunition for the player.<p>

Many enemies also return from the original games, such as the Revenant, Pinky, Mancubus, and Cyberdemon, with many also redesigned. Doom's campaign was made to be over 13 hours long, and the "Ultra-Nightmare" difficulty level features permadeath, which causes the savegame to be lost once the player dies. The campaign also features 13 maps.<p>
