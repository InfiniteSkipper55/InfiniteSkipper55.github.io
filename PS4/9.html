<h2>Summary:</h2>
The gameplay is nearly identical to the original version of the game, aside from reworked controls. Progression through <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in a landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.<p>

Progression through <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.<p>

Once a colossus is found, the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells in a unique lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus has at least one weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.<p>
