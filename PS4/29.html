<h2>Summary:</h2>
<i>Titanfall 2</i> is a first-person shooter game where players can control both a pilot and their Titans�mecha-style exoskeletons. The pilot has an large variety of abilities that enhance their efficiency during combat. These include cloaking, grappling, and parkour�such as double-jumping and wall-running�with the aid of a jump kit. These movements can be chained together to travel between locations quickly. The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics. These include: a movement system that allows players to slide on the ground, the pulse blade (which is a throwing knife that reveals the location of any nearby enemy), the holo-pilot, (a holographic pilot that mimics players' action to confuse enemies), and a grappling hook, which can be used to slingshot players to a building or an enemy it attaches to. The pilots have a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, such as shotguns, submachine guns, pistols and grenades to fight their enemies. At close range, players can execute their opponents from behind with a melee attack.<p>

Titans are significantly less mobile than the pilots, but they have stronger firearms and armor. Replacing the three classes featured in the first Titanfall, six Titans are introduced�Ion, Scorch, Northstar, Ronin, Tone and Legion. Ion uses a directed-energy arsenal. Scorch engages in combat using area-denial incendiary weaponry, Northstar excels in long-range precision attacks and setting traps, and is the only Titan with the ability to hover. Ronin specializes in close quarters combat, using a shotgun and a sword. Tone focuses on mid-range combat with its target locking weapons. Legion uses a minigun designed for defense and controlling combat zones. Finally, Monarch�added post-release via downloadable content (DLC)�is a Vanguard-class chassis that can steal power from other Titans to power up its own defensive shield. The Titans have their own move sets which are different from those of the pilots�for instance, they can dodge quickly to evade attacks.<p>
