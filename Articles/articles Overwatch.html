<h1>Get Overwatch and a Pile of Other Games for $12 Via Humble Bundle</h1>

Summer is drawing to a close, and if that makes you feel a little twinge of sadness, don�t fret. The new Humble Monthly Bundle is here to take the sting out of the transition to cooler weather and shorter days. The early unlock for October is a little different from past months in that there�s just the one game... but WHAT a game. If you�re already a subscriber, you can start playing Overwatch,
the October early unlock game, right away.<p>

This is the cheapest way to get Overwatch. Even by itself, $12 for one of the biggest games around is an enormously good deal, but add in all the other games and it's like some sort of beautiful dream. But the deal gets even sweeter with the inclusion of Overwatch Loot Boxes. If you stay subscribed through November, you'll get two bonus Overwatch loot boxes with that month's bundle, and December will toss in one more, just in time for the holidays.<p>

Getting your hands on each month�s games is a snap, too. Just visit the Humble Monthly Bundle website and sign up for $12 a month. At the beginning of each month, you gain access to the early-unlocks right away. As the month goes on, even more games become available. By the end of the month, you have so many games it�s almost an embarrassment of riches.<p>

If you ever feel overwhelmed by all the games, or there�s a game in the bundle you�re just not into, gifting them to your friends is as easy as clicking a link in your Humble library. There are no hoops to jump through, no weird permissions to give. Just send a gift link to your friends and let them enjoy a little taste of what the Humble Monthly Bundle has to offer, too.<p>


Maybe you�ve heard of the biggest competitive shooter around? Overwatch is the culmination of everything Blizzard does well: excellent design, balanced gameplay, incredible competition, and an ever-growing roster of playable characters. There has never been a cheaper price way to get your hands on Overwatch than with this month�s Humble Monthly Bundle, but you get more than just our 2016 Game of the Year. Way, WAY more.<p>
